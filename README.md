1. **Database Setup:** The `NoSQL_setup.ipynb` notebook is used to set up and update the database.
2. **Data Analysis:** The `NoSQL_analysis.ipynb` notebook handles querying relevant information for analyses and converts the results into Pandas DataFrames.
3. **Data Import:** Data from the `establishments.json` file is imported using the following command in the Terminal: `mongoimport --type json -d uk_food -c establishments --drop --jsonArray establishments.json`. This command imports the data into the MongoDB database named 'uk_food', specifically into the 'establishments' collection, replacing any existing data in the collection.

**Set Up and Update Database**

This section involved several key operations on the database:

1. **Insert New Restaurant:** A new halal restaurant located in Greenwich was added to the database using the command:
   ```python
   establishments.insert_one(new_restaurant_data)
   ```

2. **Update Restaurant Details:** The business type ID for the newly added restaurant, 'Penang Flavours', was corrected using the command:
   ```python
   establishments.update_one({'BusinessName':'Penang Flavours'}, [{'$set':{'BusinessTypeID':1}}])
   ```

3. **Remove Specific Entries:** All entries for establishments located in Dover were removed from the database with:
   ```python
   establishments.delete_many({'LocalAuthorityName': 'Dover'})
   ```

4. **Convert Geocode to Decimal:** To facilitate analysis, latitude and longitude data were converted to decimal numbers:
   ```python
   establishments.update_many({}, [{'$set': {"geocode.latitude": {'$toDecimal': '$geocode.latitude'}}}])
   establishments.update_many({}, [{'$set': {"geocode.longitude": {'$toDecimal': '$geocode.longitude'}}}])
   ```

These operations ensure the database is properly configured and updated, paving the way for accurate and efficient data analysis in subsequent sections.
